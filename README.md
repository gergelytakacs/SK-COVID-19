# SK-COVID-19

 Data and MATLAB analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in SLovakia.

I'm a control engineer, so take this with a pinch of salt. Data hand-entered based on the local Public Health Authority of the Slovak Republic (http://www.uvzsr.sk/en/) data. (Even though it would be their job to share the data online). The extrapolation is a simple exponential data fit with 95% confidence intervals at the moment. The crude estimation of the total cases is based on the study (https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) claiming a mean infection-to-symptom shift of 5 days, where the confirmed case prediction is used.
